MLDE-Enzyme-Activity-Prediction
This Repository contains the produced results of the authors MasterThesis. The repositoy will be updated accordingly.
The first predictions are based on the libraries of ProteusAI by Jonathan Funk et al. (https://github.com/jonfunk21/ProteusAI).
The results aim to create an extended library to display improved capabilities for Directed evolution e.g. including hyperparameter tuning for several models and many more embeddings and regression algorithms.
